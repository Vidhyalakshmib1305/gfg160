Given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin Letters. Return the first non-repeating character in s. If there is no non-repeating character, return '$'. <br />
Note: When you return '$' driver code will output -1.<br />
<br />
Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"<br />
Output: 'f'<br />
Explanation: In the given string, 'f' is the first character in the string which does not repeat.<br />
<br />
Input: s = "aabbccc"<br />
Output: -1<br />
Explanation: All the characters in the given string are repeating.<br />


Solution:

Used an unordered map to store the character and its occurence.<br />
TC : O(2N) ~ O(N) <br />
SC : O(k) (where k is the number of unique characters in the string since we are using the map to store the characters) <br />
