Given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin Letters. Return the first non-repeating character in s. If there is no non-repeating character, return '$'. 
Note: When you return '$' driver code will output -1.

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 'f'
Explanation: In the given string, 'f' is the first character in the string which does not repeat.<br />

Input: s = "aabbccc"
Output: -1
Explanation: All the characters in the given string are repeating.


Solution:

Used an unordered map to store the character and its occurence.
TC : O(2N) ~ O(N) <br />
SC : O(k) (where k is the number of unique characters in the string since we are using the map to store the characters)
